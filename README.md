# Styling and Animating in Vue.js

This presentation shows you some guidelines on styling Vue components and styling in general, and using the awesome built-in transition and animation features in Vue. 

I admittedly ran out of time to complete this, so things trail off in the end and these slides are missing my walk-throughs of the code, but if you saw this presentation live, you can at least check out the links to the [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) demos!

This presentation was built using [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). No, sorry, not made with Vue, though there is a [vue-slides](https://github.com/egoist/vue-slides) library you could check out.

**NOTE:** The styling in my custom Vue reveal.js theme is quick and sloppy and not a good representation of good styling. Thought I'd mention that since this a presentation on styling. However, before you go editing or using it, know that I will be most likely publishing a cleaner version with more complete styling, as this won't be the last Vue presentation I'll be doing. :)

**NOTE 2:** The emojis do not work in Windows! I'll update the implementation of the [emoji-js](https://github.com/iamcal/js-emoji/) library. If you come up with a clean solution, feel free to pass it on!
